# 01 Screensaver
04/02/2025

## Introduction
This repository contains the code needed to create a custom screensaver designed to mimic video game loading screensâ€”but with a real-life twist. Instead of in-game hints, the screensaver displays real-life gaming tips, blending humor and practical advice.

The template used for the background comes from Need For Speed Most Wanted 5.2.0 (for PSP), Upscaled using AI (any AI upscaler on the internet). Note that I do not own the rights for that game, for which the credits go to Electronic Arts.

## Disclaimer
Some tips contain jokes or satire. These are **just jokes** and should not be taken as real advice. Modify tips.txt and the images as needed to match your sense of humor. 
The images used for this project come mainly from Google Images. I do not own the rights to these images. If you're using this for a commercial project, ensure you have the appropriate rights to the images.

## Full Download

To save storage space, images and powerpoint are not included in this repository. Instead, they can be downloaded from Google Drive, which for redundancy also contains the code.

## How To Run
Once the code is obtained (either just the code via GitHub or the code+images from Google Drive) the fun can start:
1. first, modify the images.pptx PowerPoint according to the images you need. When you are done, export the PowerPoint to pdf, and save the file to the same location as the .pptx
2. then, run "py_01_create_decription_images.py" to create the various description images from the pdf
3. you can then run "py_02_create_screensaver.py" to create the Screensaver pictures, stored in "02_output_screensaver_images"
4. finally, you can set your computer to use the images in "02_output_screensaver_images" for Screensaver purposes
