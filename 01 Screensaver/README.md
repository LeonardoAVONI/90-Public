# 01 Screensaver
04/02/2025

## Introduction
This repository contains the code needed to create a custom Screensaver. The idea of this screensaver is to replicate the loading screens of a videogame, but adapting it to real life; hence the tips provided by the "loading screen" will actually be for real life. There are jokes in the tips. For legal reasons, those are nothing more than jokes.
Feel free to modify the tips.txt as well as the used images if the Screensaver images don't align with your humour.
Also, don't forget to have fun!

## Full Download
For storage space reasons, the images used are not on Github, but on Google Drive. The images come mainly from Google Images; I do not own the rights for those images, so pay attention in case of commmercial projects.
The HD pictures and PowerPoint file used to modify them is available at the following Google Drive link:

## How To Run
Once the code is obtained (either just the code via GitHub or the code+images from Google Drive) the fun can start:
-first, modify the images.pptx PowerPoint according to the images you need. When you are done, export the PowerPoint to pdf, and save the file to the same location as the .pptx
-then, run "py_01_create_decription_images.py" to create the various description images from the pdf
-you can then run "py_02_create_screensaver.py" to create the Screensaver pictures, stored in "02_output_screensaver_images"
-finally, you can set your computer to use the images in "02_output_screensaver_images" for Screensaver purposes
